    "text": "The ADAPTATE Program aims to ensure that state institutions and municipalities, in coordination with private sector groups and companies, as well as educational institutions, coherently meet the goals and objectives for climate change adaptation and rural development, within the framework of legal regulations, procedures, and Guatemala’s international obligations.\nThis study evaluates the economic risks associated with the impacts of climate change and how they affect the business sector in Guatemala to:\n\nDetermine the current and future impacts of climate change in Guatemala.\nQuantify the economic risk associated with climate change.\nEvaluate the risk to key economic activities affected by climate threats in Guatemala.\n\nThis document seeks to present existing information on climate change vulnerability in the country through a multi-criteria approach of diverse analytical perspectives, similar to those used in investment decision-making in capital markets. It is hoped that this will help make a more convincing argument for Guatemalan companies to make climate change adaptation a strategic priority.\nGuatemala has significant initiatives that gather climate change information for decision-making on adaptation. For example, as part of the REDD+ Strategy consolidation project, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) has systematized Guatemala’s official information on climate science, vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation through the National Climate Change Information System (SNICC) (MARN, 2023). Another relevant example is the Guatemalan Climate Change Science System (SGCCC), integrated by several academic and research institutions in the country, in agreement with MARN, whose objective is to be the “entity responsible for reviewing and generating scientific information and transferring it to political decision-makers regarding the main components of climate change: Climate Science, Adaptation and Vulnerability, and Mitigation and GHG Inventories” (SGCCC, 2023).\nSimilarly, there is the Municipal Planning in Climate Change (PlaniMuCC) portal, whose objective is to make relevant data for climate change adaptation and vulnerability analysis accessible to governmental institutions at all levels so that they consider the results of the climate change vulnerability analysis in municipal planning and land-use planning (SEGEPLAN, 2023). Also at the municipal level, the Risk Management Index (INFORM) helps identify where there is a greater risk of damage and loss due to various phenomena, not limited to climate change (CONRED, 2023). These systems share a common focus on identifying threat, exposure, sensitivity, and risk to vulnerable populations to enable local governments and government institutions to make planning and policy design decisions.\nHowever, in terms of productive issues, these initiatives focus more on the subsistence agricultural sector and how risks to it can result in a decline in the livelihoods of at-risk populations. The business sector has typically been tasked with mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through energy transformation processes and efficiency improvements, but it is less clear how it can also be affected by climate change in its value generation processes, leading business people to consider climate issues as something beyond their decision-making timeline and, consequently, outside their strategic planning (TCFD, 2017). This study seeks to provide elements to change that perception.\nThe approach started with an organizational framework for information on climate change vulnerability, linking it to financial impacts on companies. Given the wealth of geo-referenced information on vulnerability, a geographic territorialization of the country’s economic activity was conducted using a novel satellite information technique to determine the proportions of GDP generation at risk. This territorialization was then contrasted with various sources of vulnerability information. Finally, a series of economic activities of interest were selected according to an environmental input-output analysis that ranked these activities according to their direct contribution to four axes (value generation, employment generation, water use, and energy use). Additionally, an in-depth analysis was conducted for eight selected economic activities, focusing on their input structure to determine bottlenecks related to financial risks from climate change and associated costs.\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Territorialization of the Economy\nOne of the most important challenges in financial risk analysis related to climate change is the fact that these risks exhibit very heterogeneous geographic behavior. While some regions may expect increasing levels of drought, for example, adjacent regions may experience forecasts of increased torrential rains simply because they are on the other side of a mountain range. Since the geographic disaggregation of climate variables and natural resources is important, it is also crucial to know the level of economic activity with the highest possible geographic disaggregation. However, detailed information on economic activities described by the National Accounts System (Banguat, 2023a) is only available at the national level.\nTo overcome this limitation, this study territorialized the economic activity of non-agricultural sectors through the night light analysis methodology[^1]. For this, geo-referenced information from night light sensors –Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)– (Elvidge et al., 2013) was used to estimate the distribution of economic activity at more disaggregated regional scales that can be contrasted with the existing geo-referenced information on climate threats in Guatemala. In this way, an informed valuation of the volume of economic activity at risk in monetary units (quetzales) was made. Night light observations have shown a strong correlation with regional gross product in previous studies (Chen & Nordhaus, 2011). Figure 3 shows the average night light for each month of 2020, condensed into a single image, using the median as the reduction function. Previous studies have determined that the median (as opposed to the mean) shows less distortion in water bodies, allowing for a more accurate regional gross domestic product estimate (Suarez, 2016). The night light within each municipality was calculated, and the fraction of the total night light in each of them was determined. Then the non-agricultural GDP was distributed according to these fractions. Annex I shows more details of the methodology used.\nFigure 3. Geo-referenced Night Light Information\n\nSource: Own elaboration with night light data (World Bank, 2023).\nFigure 4 shows the result of this calculation, detailing how the different municipal contributions to non-agricultural economic activities’ GDP are distributed for all municipalities in the country. It is clear that at the highest level is the municipality of Guatemala, in the department of the same name, whose contribution corresponds to 13.72% of the non-agricultural GDP. At the next level (with contributions between 2.3 and 5.5 percent) are some other municipalities in the metropolitan area of Guatemala City and the municipality of Quetzaltenango. At a third level (with contributions between 1.1 and 2.3 percent) are the municipalities where the country’s two important ports are located in Izabal and Escuintla, as well as the departmental head of the latter and the urban area of Huehuetenango. Visible on the map with a slightly colored tone, the penultimate level (with contributions between 0.3 and 1.1 percent) is consistent with most departmental heads, with the clear absences of the departments of Baja Verapaz and Sololá, which do not have municipalities at this level, and El Progreso, whose economic activity is more concentrated in the municipality of Sanarate and not in the head Guastatoya. The rest of the municipalities, which blend into the lightest color in Figure 4, have contributions of less than 0.3% of the non-agricultural GDP. Out of a total of 343 municipalities, the 63 visible on the map represented 77.4% of the economic activity, equivalent to Q516.7 billion (~$66.2 billion) in 2022. Of these, the 16 most important (i.e., contributing more than 1.1% to non-agricultural GDP) represented 50.5%, equivalent to Q337.1 billion (~$43.2 billion) in 2022.\nFigure 4. Municipal Percentage Contribution to Non-Agricultural GDP\n\nNote: The percentage corresponds to the GDP only of non-agricultural sectors.\nSource: Own elaboration with night light data (World Bank, 2023) and National Accounts (Banguat, 2023a).\nIn summary, Table 2 aggregates the municipal contributions to non-agricultural GDP by department, which, when ordered from lowest to highest, show a marked Pen parade effect (Pen, 1974) in which the department of Guatemala is the giant (40.85%) followed by dwarfs, as the second on the list, Escuintla (9.46%), is barely a quarter of the first, and the last place (Baja Verapaz) is 20 times smaller. The 10 departments with the highest contributions correspond to 81.6% of the non-agricultural GDP, equivalent to Q541.4 billion in 2022, among which are Guatemala (40.85%), Escuintla (9.46%), Quetzaltenango (7.44%), San Marcos (4.47%), Sacatepéquez (4.44%), Petén (3.67%), Huehuetenango (3.26%), Chimaltenango (2.81%), Izabal (2.78%), Suchitepéquez (2.44%). In last place of all 22 departments is Baja Verapaz with a contribution of 0.5% of the non-agricultural GDP, equivalent to Q3.3 billion.\nTable 2.

The agricultural GDP was equivalent to 9.9% of the total GDP, reaching a total of Q72.9 billion in 2022. Adding the agricultural fraction to the previously calculated 90.1%, distributed among the 22 departments, produces few changes in the ranking shown above, with the clear exception of Petén, whose agricultural activity has grown significantly in recent years and in 2022 was responsible for nearly half of all the country’s agricultural economic activity (48.9% or Q35.7 billion).\nTable 3.

    "text": "The Importance of the Road Network and Climate Threats\nOnce the non-agricultural GDP contributions were geographically distributed, comparisons with localized information were made. Figure 5 shows the road network overlaid on the economic activity territorialization calculations (paved in black and unpaved in gray). It is evident for the 63 municipalities visible in the figure, beyond the lightest color, the positive correlation between being connected by the paved road network and higher levels of economic activity compared to other municipalities not interconnected by this network. Although correlation does not imply causation, it is clear that maintaining this interconnection is important for the 77.4% of the non-agricultural GDP (Q516.7 billion or ~$66.2 billion in 2022) carried out in these municipalities. The situation becomes complicated when intersecting the map of flood-prone areas with the road network (SEGEPLAN, 2023). Figure 5 also shows the road sections (blue dots) and bridges (red dots) under flood threat. As a contrast, the map in Figure 6 provides a visual summary of the number of paved road sections under flood threat by municipality, with a scale adjusted to the data. Notably, two of the highest values are located precisely in the municipalities where the country’s most important international trade ports are located (San José, Escuintla, and Puerto Barrios, Izabal).\nFigure 5. GDP, Road Network, Bridges, and Road Sections under Flood Threat\n\nSource: Own elaboration with non-agricultural GDP regionalization by night light and road network (Banguat, 2023b; SEGEPLAN, 2023; World Bank, 2023).\nFigure 6. Paved Road Sections under Flood Threat by Municipality\n\nSource: Own elaboration with PlaniMuCC data (SEGEPLAN, 2023).\nGiven the importance evidenced by the paved road network, it is essential to understand the possible exposure to risk when having product transport or supply operations in each department. Table 4 details the number of bridges and paved road sections under flood risk by department. For reference, the kilometers of the paved road network in each department and a measure to compare flood risk by department based on the number of sections at risk per 100 kilometers of the paved road network in the department are also included. Here, it is pertinent to reflect that a road network interruption due to flooding not only affects the economic activity of the municipality in question but also all trade that transits from one point to another via that route. Particular attention should be given to the fact that it is the access to the ports that are most at risk in this regard.\nTable 4.

The same analysis can be conducted for points on the paved road network that are at risk of landslides. The map in Figure 7 shows road network segments at risk of landslides as yellow points with red outlines, while the municipality’s tone denotes the number of such points within its territory on a scale adjusted to the data for better visual comparison between municipalities.\nFigure 7. Paved Road Segments at Landslide Risk by Municipality\n\nSource: Own elaboration with PlaniMuCC data (SEGEPLAN, 2023).\nIt is evident that the Inter-American Highway (CA-1) is under significant threat of this type, especially in the West towards the border with Mexico at La Mesilla and on National Route 1 (RN-1) towards the border points with Mexico in the department of San Marcos. Landslide obstruction possibilities are also seen towards the borders with El Salvador via CA-1 East and Honduras via CA-9 (Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán Highway), CA-10, and CA-11.\nInterestingly, in extreme precipitation events, both risks—landslides and floods—are likely to occur simultaneously at different points on the road network. Protecting the paved road network with appropriate construction codes, national and local contingency plans, and adequate public and private disaster response funding is a national economic security issue. The next section evaluates the risk of extreme weather events occurring in municipalities and, given the territorialization of economic activity, the amount of GDP exposed to such risks."

    "text": "Natural Disaster Risk at the Municipal Level\nThe Risk Management Index is a tool that helps “identify where there is the greatest risk of damage and loss from various phenomena,” providing data that allow the evaluation of three dimensions of systemic risk: hazard and exposure; vulnerability; and lack of response capacity on normalized scales from 0 to 1 for each dimension and category within them (CONRED, 2023). The map in Figure 8 shows the INFORM index for the hazard and exposure dimension to natural events, which captures municipalities’ exposure to hydrometeorological events that occurred between 2008 and 2021 and normalizes it on a scale from zero to one, aggregated into categories ranging from “very low hazard” to “very high hazard.”\nFigure 8. INFORM Risk Management Index at the Municipal Level (Natural Disasters)\n\nSource: Risk Management Index (CONRED, 2023).\nAs shown in section 3.1, the country’s non-agricultural economic activity was territorialized at the municipal level. Knowing the contribution in quetzales to each municipality’s GDP allowed estimating the cost of economic exposure to natural disaster risk identified in the INFORM scale. Table 5 shows this exercise for Guatemala in 2022. Each row shows the sum of monetary contributions to the GDP of the municipalities in the identified department under each risk category identified in the following columns. Also, for each row, the darkest red color identifies the highest value(s) for that department. The last row shows the percentages of GDP by INFORM risk category. It is important to note that 57.4% of GDP (equivalent to Q381.9 billion in 2022) is generated in municipalities with “high” (20.7%, Q137.5 billion) or “very high” (36.7%, Q243.6 billion) natural disaster risk. It is also worth noting that significant amounts in “high” or “very high” are widespread in many departments, not just those that contribute the most to GDP overall.\nTable 5.

    "text": "Water Stress\nWithin each micro-watershed in the country, various factors influence water availability. These factors include precipitation, runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, among others. Opposing water availability within a water balance are uses, which can be natural, agricultural, industrial, commercial, or residential. By subtracting the use needs from availability, a remaining balance known as the water balance is obtained. In a comparison exercise between the water balance and the projected population for the year of analysis, Pérez-Irungaray (2020) determined the availability of water per inhabitant per year for each municipality, based on the water balance in their micro-watersheds. Using criteria established in the literature, which indicate that areas experience water stress below an availability of 1,700 m³ of water per inhabitant per year, the various municipalities were classified as very high, high, medium, low, and very low water stress. Since, in that calculation, the numerator is the availability of cubic meters of water per year and the denominator is the number of inhabitants, the more densely populated the areas, the more likely they are to experience water stress. The map in Figure 9 shows the municipalities according to their water stress category, which is consistent with the country’s most densely populated areas, corresponding to the metropolitan area of Guatemala City, the urban area around Quetzaltenango, and several municipalities in the Western Highlands.\nFigure 9. Water Stress Defined as Municipalities with Less than 1,700 m³ of Water per Inhabitant per Year as a Result of the Water Balance\n\nSource: Own elaboration based on municipal water balance and water stress classification criteria (Pérez-Irungaray, 2020).\nAlthough Figure 9 appears to suggest that few areas currently suffer from water stress, economically, municipalities with high and very high water stress represent 42.1% of the non-agricultural GDP, equivalent to Q278.9 billion, according to the territorialization of the economy presented earlier, as shown in Table 6. It is important to understand that it is not possible to easily move production to areas with lower threat levels, as there are no infrastructure and skilled labor conditions to relocate production to other areas. Moreover, the situation is likely to worsen before it improves, as projections of the country’s total water availability (in millions of m³ per year) according to the A2 climate change scenario suggest that by 2050, only 86.7% of the water availability that existed in 2020 will be available, as seen in Table 7 (Maas et al., 2020). At the same time, the population is also growing, exerting more pressure on water availability and increasing water stress conditions. According to the same source, projections indicate that the percentage of the population under water stress conditions will increase from 43% in 2020 to 64%, regarding the availability of surface, subsurface, and groundwater (Maas et al., 2020).\nTable 6.

In 2021, of the 11,943.08 GWh of electricity generated in the country, half, that is, 5,960.29 GWh, corresponded to hydroelectric generation (MEM, 2022). A noticeable reduction in the generating capacity of the country’s more than 40 hydroelectric plants, even temporarily, can cause disturbances in the electricity supply or a generalized increase in electricity costs. It must be understood that the price of electricity is determined by the costs of the least efficient machine in operation at any given time (CNEE, 2013). A temporary reduction in hydroelectric generation necessitates filling the deficit with less efficient technologies that can quickly enter production but with higher costs, leading the system to set higher prices per energy unit. As will be seen in the next section, the degree of energy dependence of economic activities, whether direct in the form of high energy input usage or indirect in the form of dependence on inputs whose production is high in energy use, becomes an element of financial risk exposure due to climate change."

    "text": "Appendix I. Methodology\n\nEnvironmentally Extended Input-Output Model to Reveal Sectors with Greater Exposure to Financial Risks from Climate Change\nAn environmentally extended input-output model is used to conduct a multiplier analysis (Miller & Blair, 2009; Vargas, 2015) and thus rank the country’s economic activities according to their direct and indirect contributions to four axes: value added (GDP), employment, water use, and energy use. For this, information from the System of National Accounts (Banguat, 2019b, 2019a, 2023a) and the System of Environmental Accounts (Banguat & URL/Iarna, 2009; Carrera, 2019; IARNA/URL, 2007; Vargas, 2022) is utilized.\nThe use of the System of National Accounts (Banguat, 2019a); specifically, the Supply and Use Tables (Banguat, 2023a), allows for in-depth analysis of selected sectors, identifying the magnitude in quetzales of their input needs that may be at risk from various types of climate risks (e.g., landslides, floods, and productivity losses in the workforce due to rising average temperatures).\n\nBasic Input-Output Model\nInitially, to use the information from the official input-output matrix of the Bank of Guatemala (Banguat, 2019b), a basic industry-by-industry input-output model was used, which was then extended to consider the direct and indirect uses of full-time jobs, water, and energy from Guatemala’s environmental accounts (Banguat & URL/Iarna, 2009; IARNA/URL, 2007; Vargas, 2022). The following uses matrix notation derived by the author in a previous study (Vargas, 2015).\nThe matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z} = \\left\\lbrack z_{ij} \\right\\rbrack\\) identifies the purchases of industry \\(i\\) produced by industry \\(j\\), whose sum represents the input purchases by the economy in monetary terms. It is square with the same number of economic activities on each side. The economy is divided into \\(n\\) activities. The vector \\(\\mathbf{f}\\mathbf{=}\\left\\lbrack f_{\\mathbf{i}} \\right\\rbrack\\) shows the purchases of final demand from activity \\(i\\), while the vector \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\left\\lbrack x_{i} \\right\\rbrack\\) represents the production of activity \\(i\\). This is expressed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{Zi} + \\mathbf{f.}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) is a summation vector of ones with length n. Given this, the inputs per monetary unit of production (direct input coefficients) are defined as \\(\\mathbf{A =}\\left\\lbrack a_{\\mathbf{ij}}\\mathbf{=}z_{ij}/x_{ij} \\right\\rbrack\\), which in matrix notation is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\(\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{Z}{\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}}^{\\mathbf{- 1}}\\). | (2) =================================================+=========+\n\n\n\n\n\nDerived from (2) and (1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{Ax} + \\mathbf{f,}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving for f (respecting matrix algebra rules) expresses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\[\\left( \\mathbf{I - A} \\right)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{f.}\\] =================================================+=========\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the input-output model is demand-driven, implying that if changes to demand are simulated, a new production value can be estimated by solving (4) to reveal x, introducing the new demand (\\(\\mathbf{f}\\)), as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\left( \\mathbf{I - A} \\right)^{\\mathbf{- 1}}\\mathbf{f = Lf.}\\] | (5) =================================================+=========+\n\n\n\n\n\nIn equation (5), \\(\\left( \\mathbf{I - A} \\right)^{\\mathbf{- 1}}\\mathbf{= L =}\\left\\lbrack l_{ij} \\right\\rbrack\\) represents the Leontief Inverse or the matrix of direct and indirect requirements. Each of its elements represents the additional direct and indirect production that must occur in economic activity i to meet an additional unit of final demand of activity j.\n\n\nEnvironmental and Employment Extension of the Basic Model\nThe extension of the input-output model is done by transforming the total production of x in equation (5) into its physical equivalent (employment, energy, water, etc.). By having the total use of these physical factors by economic activity (a vector w) in the environmental accounts (Banguat & URL/Iarna, 2009; IARNA/URL, 2007; Vargas, 2022), a vector (c) can be created to identify the physical quantity of resource w used per unit of product x:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\[\\mathbf{c = \\lbrack}\\frac{w_{i}}{x_{i}}\\rbrack\\] | (6) =================================================+=========+\n\n\n\n\n\nPremultiplying c with the input-output model yields a single scalar (number) of the total resource use in question derived from a new final demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\[w = \\mathbf{c}^{\\mathbf{'}}\\mathbf{Lf}\\mathbf{.}\\] | (7) =================================================+=========+\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as it is necessary to know the corresponding elements for each sector, a diagonal version of c is used, which when premultiplying by x, gives w again as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathbf{w} = \\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{Lf}\\] | (8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only premultiplying by \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) initially, the following structure is obtained:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathbf{i}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathbf{n}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{11}} & \\ldots & {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{1n}} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\\\ {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{1}} & & {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{nn}} \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathbf{i}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathbf{n}} \\end{pmatrix}\\] | (9) =================================================+=========+\n\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix (\\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L = H}\\)) identifies the additional physical use (environmental or employment) that occurs when an additional monetary unit is purchased by final demand (environmental or employment impact multipliers); our physical equivalent of (L). This is interesting because it shows the economic activities that have a greater marginal impact on the use of environmental or employment resources. It is also important to find the total environmental or employment impact that occurs between sectors to find not only the economic activity of the sector but of its entire value chain. This is achieved by multiplying by a diagonal version of (\\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{f}}\\)) so that the model results in a matrix \\(\\mathbf{W} = \\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}\\widehat{\\mathbf{f}}\\) instead of a vector. From (9) it results that,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{11}} & \\ldots & \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{n}} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\\\ \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{1}} & & \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{nn}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{11}} & \\ldots & {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{n}} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\\\ {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{1}} & & {\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{L}}_{\\mathbf{nn}} \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} {\\widehat{\\mathbf{f}}}_{\\mathbf{11}} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\ddots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & {\\widehat{\\mathbf{f}}}_{\\mathbf{nn}} \\end{pmatrix}\\] | (10) =================================================+=========+\n\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix (\\(\\mathbf{W}\\)) shows how environmental or employment use is distributed throughout the economy, from industries that sell to industries that buy inputs, embedded in direct and indirect transactions necessary to meet final demand. Similarly, a matrix of direct uses of the physical resource =\\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{c}}\\mathbf{A}\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\) can be estimated using equation (2) to obtain the three individual values per physical resource: (i) direct use of the resource, (ii) total use of the resource; and (iii) indirect use of the resource, as the difference of the first two.\n\n\n\nTerritorialization of Non-Agricultural Economic Activity Under Risk\nThe previously described macroeconomic information is produced on a national scale, and with the exception of the agricultural and forestry sectors, there is uncertainty about the geographic distribution of economic activity in other sectors. However, climate information has an important geographic location component, and this raises the need to extend a link between socioeconomic information and the territory. The National Directory of Companies and their Premises –DINEL– (Banguat, 2014) indicates that a disproportionate 62.1% of companies are located in the department of Guatemala, while the second department on the list, Quetzaltenango, follows with only 4.7% of the companies. This directory has the limitation that it reflects the place where the companies are registered and not the places where they operate. Furthermore, it is limited to those companies with administrative and accounting information (formal) outside informal premises and market stalls.\nWhile the information is useful for certain sectors such as mining and manufacturing, whose production is linked to the location of the factory or production unit, this disaggregation is more limited for economic activities such as retail trade and other services that locate their headquarters in a specific place but carry out their activities in various locations throughout the country. However, the information will be used to establish a reference point with the nighttime lights information, explained in the following paragraph.\nTo approximate the disaggregation of value added generation in the country’s non-agricultural economic activities, georeferenced information from nighttime radiance sensors –Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, VIIRS– (Elvidge et al., 2013) is used to estimate the distribution of economic activity at more disaggregated regional scales that can be contrasted with existing georeferenced climate threat information in Guatemala and thus make an informed assessment of the volume of economic activity at risk in quetzales. Nighttime radiance observations have been shown to have a strong correlation with regional gross domestic product in the literature (Chen & Nordhaus, 2011).\nFor this study, a processed version of the aforementioned satellite data was used (Elvidge et al., 2013), optimized not to show clouds and other artifacts produced by satellite sensors, maintained and distributed by the World Bank (World Bank, 2023). The radiance information was then contrasted with land use and cover information (ESA, 2023; GIMBOT, 2014) to correct the data to account only for radiance emitted over built-up areas. This allowed for the elimination of out-of-range observations emitted by active volcanoes and other sources not corresponding to human activity. Finally, the fraction of the total luminosity corresponding to the geographical area of each municipality was calculated, equating the same with non-agricultural economic activity. The Value Added data of economic activities were distributed according to these fractions (to get the GDP, net taxes on subsidies were added to each activity according to the size of its contribution to the Total Value Added, an adjustment necessary according to the GDP calculation methodology by the production side). The median of the average monthly radiance for the year 2020, condensed into a single image, was used. Previous studies have determined that the median shows fewer distortions in water bodies, allowing for a more accurate regional gross domestic product estimation (Suarez, 2016).\nData was accessed through Earth Engine[^3], using the following code and exporting:\nvar VIIRS_GT_2020 = ee.ImageCollection(\n    \\\"NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG\\\"\n    ).filterDate( \\\"2020-12-01\\\",\\\"2020-12-31\\\"\n    ).select( \\'avg_rad\\' ).median()."

Nighttime radiance observations have been shown to have a strong correlation with regional gross domestic product in the literature (Chen & Nordhaus, 2011).\nFor this study, a processed version of the aforementioned satellite data was used (Elvidge et al., 2013), optimized not to show clouds and other artifacts produced by satellite sensors, maintained and distributed by the World Bank (World Bank, 2023). The radiance information was then contrasted with land use and cover information (ESA, 2023; GIMBOT, 2014) to correct the data to account only for radiance emitted over built-up areas. This allowed for the elimination of out-of-range observations emitted by active volcanoes and other sources not corresponding to human activity. Finally, the fraction of the total luminosity corresponding to the geographical area of each municipality was calculated, equating the same with non-agricultural economic activity. The Value Added data of economic activities were distributed according to these fractions (to get the GDP, net taxes on subsidies were added to each activity according to the size of its contribution to the Total Value Added, an adjustment necessary according to the GDP calculation methodology by the production side). The median of the average monthly radiance for the year 2020, condensed into a single image, was used. Previous studies have determined that the median shows fewer distortions in water bodies, allowing for a more accurate regional gross domestic product estimation (Suarez, 2016).\nData was accessed through Earth Engine, using the following code and exporting:\n```javascript var VIIRS_GT_2020 = ee.ImageCollection(     “NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG”     ).filterDate(“2020-12-01”,“2020-12-31”     ).select(‘avg_rad’).median();"

    "title": "Hello World",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A “Hello, World!” program is usually a simple computer program that emits (or displays) to the screen (often the console) a message similar to “Hello, World!”. A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language’s basic syntax. [It can] be used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it. —Wikipedia\n\nI am excited about computers like I haven’t been in a couple of decades. It just feels like there’s a lot of innovation happening and we’re just spoiled with great open source projects in data science, in game development, in web programming and in in systems programming. Oh, and none of this is related to AI.\nI am an economist and, in this day and age, that necessarily means being a data scientist, but there has been so much innovation in the data science world that I have almost forgotten about the economics part. I can’t remember the last time I read an econ paper for fun, but I do remember devouring the documentation for Quarto—the open source system on top of which this website is created—just because of how innovative it feels, even if I know that it is based on a technology that’s been around for decades. I’ll tell you why I think that is a few lines later in this post.\nThe language and environment for statistical computing and graphics called R is a part of my identity. I am not an R expert, but I do a lot of my work with it. Having worked for many years exclusively with Excel, I just feel like Dr. Strange conjuring up magic circles of energy when I manipulate R objects and complete tasks that used to take me months, weeks, or years in some cases, in just a couple of minutes.\nNow, R has also been around for a few decades, but it is such a vibrant community that it is difficult to keep up with the sheer amount of amazing packages or libraries that come out every day, expanding its functionality in incredible ways. I am a sucker for the library(tidyverse) bundle of packages, for example. There are verbs for data manipulation (dplyr), there’s a grammar for graphics (ggplot2), there’s a simple way of handling order (forcats) and so much more. I just feel so grateful that Hadley Wickham and all the nice folks at Posit decided to make all of these incredible projects open-source.\nThen there’s Python, which is a general programming language that is not only great for data science; it’s the glue that holds a lot of data processing pipelines together. It seems like there is a Python API for any innovative piece of software out there. I use it a lot for geospatial computations. R is great for this too, but Python became sort of the lingua franca of batch GIS analysis and there’s just a lot more documentation out there, and so I tend to favor it for GIS work. Lately, I have been exploring creating command line interfaces (CLI) with the Typer library to make my scripts shareable with colleagues that don’t have Python knowledge.\nIn the world of operating systems, Linux is just hitting it out of the park. I have been a Linux enthusiast since 2007 and I have always had a Linux machine that I tinkered with at home. However, two years ago, things felt so advanced and easy to use at the same time that I made the switch to Linux Mint on my desktop daily driver. Haven’t looked back since. A year ago I also made the switch on my main laptop, which now boasts Fedora 43 with KDE. I keep a Windows 11 laptop at hand, which I use to teach R, just because I want the people I train, who mostly use Windows to see a familiar interface on screen, but I don’t miss it at all.\nLately, I’ve been excited about Omarchy, which is what David Heinemeier Hansson calls “an opinionated Linux distribution,” built on top of Arch Linux. It just feels beautiful out of the box. The technologies have been here all along, but the aesthetic way they have been put together—with a sort of 70s and 80s text-based aesthetic—just make me want to sit and tinker with configuration files all day long. After a morning of keyboard shortcuts and tiling window managers, you just feel like that’s the only way to use a computer. At some point, I am probably going to switch from Fedora to Omarchy on that laptop I was telling you about. Related to this, there’s also Ruby on Rails 8. Rails powers a lot of websites you probably use and with its 8 release they went back to the philosophy that a single programmer/founder should be able to materialize their idea without a massive infrastructure or team. How great is that? I just picked up the Rails book. I’m definitely learning it this time.\nBack in 2007, I felt curious about Linux, and R, and LaTeX, because they seemed like remanents from a more innovative era in the 70s, 80s, and perhaps early 90s, where people did a lot of stuff, as opposed to mainly just consume a lot of stuff as “content”. I don’t know if it’s part of the Social Media fatigue that people seem to be experiencing, but all those new projects out there today that have nothing to do with AI, make me think we are in a tinkering Reinassance and I couldn’t be more excited for it.\nAny typos you find here are actually on purpose."
