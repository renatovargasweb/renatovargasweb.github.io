Over 20 years of experience researching, writing, and speaking about the link between economics, environmental sustainability and social issues. With a demonstrated history of helping organizations, such as The World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Inter-American Development Bank, create data-backed and science-based top quality editorial content to educate and persuade clients, disseminate ideas among stakeholders, support institutional goals, and back public and private policies.


**I specialize in:**

- **Environmental Accounts Analysis:** Environmentally-Extended Macroeconomic-Accounting analysis, based on the principles of the **System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA)**. Latest development include the design of a Bioeconomy Macro-Accounting Framework for 13 Latin American countries.

- **General Equilibrium Modeling:** Trained in the use of models like **GTAP, IEEM,** and the **PEP** family of models for environmentally-extended economic analysis and the energy transition.

- **Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Modeling:** Developed an environmentally-extended macroeconomic analysis framework for rapid policy impact analysis in **R**.

- **Household Survey Poverty Analysis:** I analyze the effects of climate-induced risks on income and expenditure distributions at the regional level with advanced household survey analysis in **R** or **Stata**.

- **Ecosystem Service and Land Use Change Modeling:** Experience in the implementation of the InVEST suite of ecosystem service modeling tools and the use of S-CLUE to model Land Use Land Cover change. 

- **Technical writing:** I have two decades of experience writing flagship reports, scientific papers, policy notes, and dissemination articles on sustainability and environmentally-extended economic analysis for different audiences, including policy-makers, technical staff, academics, and the general public.

- **Data Management and Data Analysis:** With a thorough understanding of data analytical tools and experience in monoitoring and evaluation, I leverage programming environments like **R, Python, GAMS, GEMPACK,** and **Stata**, as well as **Quarto, RShiny, Tableau, and PowerBI** among others, to create analytical products, databases and dashboards for analysis projects and flagship reports.

- **Training:** I provide specialized training in macroeconomic data management and analysis for policy design and evaluation teams, using a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach.
