::: {#personal-intro-box .alert .alert-light role="alert"}
Hey there! I use **R**, **Python**, and **other innovative data science technologies** to help organizations analyze complex economic, environmental, and social problems. Here are some of the [**types of analysis**](about.qmd#sec-services) in which I specialize and here are the [**things I've done**](about.qmd#sec-professional-experience). Some of those have resulted in interesting [**publications**](about.qmd#sec-publications). I am an independent consultant/freelancer and I am always on the lookout for new and interesting challenges. Perhaps there's something we can collaborate on, or maybe you just want to connect. Feel free to reach out on [**LinkedIn**]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/revargas/") where I'm fairly active.
